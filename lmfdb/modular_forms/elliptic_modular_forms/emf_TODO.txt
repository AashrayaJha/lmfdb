CRITICAL (BUGS):
* knowls: rigor, cande, source in the new scheme (and indicate that CM is rigorous but inner twist is numerical)
* Dirichlet character pages: The modular form 60.2.i.a claims the character label is 60.i, but the linked Dirichlet character page (for 60.17) says the orbit label is 60.q.
* data: missing exact q-expansions, e.g. 17.4.a.b, 20.5.d.c
* data: sometimes all angles are zero in hecke_mf_cc, e.g. 11.2.a.a, 1.12.a.a, 17.4.a.b and 17.4.a.a
* data: Need to create mf_oldsubs table (including for Gamma_1 if we want to not display empty spaces in decomposition)
* data: populate embeddings column by computing roots of defining polynomials and matching with complex data
* data: Add isogeny_class_label so that we can include friend links to elliptic curves
* search results: next button not working

IMPORTANT:
* search page: change the character search field: should give a letter (we should have a discussion about whether we require input of the form N.i that includes the level)
* search_page: add order of character
* space pages: add text explaining the dimensions
* space pages: properties box should have something
* search results: Download search results
* Dirichlet char pages: list orbit labels
* form pages: should be three options for minimal: is minimal twist, is not minimal twist, is not known
* form pages: get download coefficients to work, say total number of coefficients
* form pages: display what the inner twists actually are (as orbits of characters)
* form pages: download to Sage/Magma/pari (both stored coefficients and using cutters)
* space pages: download to Sage/Magma/pari
* stats pages
* disable or recompute: http://www.lmfdb.org/L/degree2/CuspForm/
* Add link on asterisk for inner twist explaining that our inner twist computations are not rigorous
* knowls: mf.elliptic.hecke_order, mf.elliptic.embedding_label
* knowls: make sure top and bottom knowls, explicit formulas are ported over

FORMATTING:
* L-function pages: should we use equals instead of colon?
* form pages: "Character orbit" and "(character) label" should be their own knowls
* form pages: Conrey label should be a knowl, and say character orbit
* form pages: replace 'Hecke' with 'coefficients' throughout, mention Hecke in knowl instead, replace 'order' with 'ring'
* form pages: when dimension large, the related objects sidebar runs into the complex eigenvalues (e.g. 83.2.c.a).  We should probably limit the number of L-function links displayed.
* form pages: would the basis for the Hecke ring look better in a vertical table?
* space pages: add remark on empty spaces when ruled out by parity
* L-function pages: fix fonts arithmetic/analytic normalization
* L-function pages: Remove n/a from friends (just leave it unclickable)
* L-function apges: is gray for negative values best? (why not two separate lists?)

IT WOULD BE NICE IF:
* form pages: had code snippets
* space pages: had code snippets
* knowls: more
* form pages: if Hecke ring is a power basis, order the generators by the powers and pretty print the q-expansion
* form pages: if Hecke field is cyclotomic, use zeta instead
* identify (if possible?) a more precise description of the twisting characters
* L-function pages: sign could be recognized as a root of unity, when applicable
* data: compute exact Hecke eigenvalues in pari, compare with computed in Magma
* data: download data from old version and compare to see matches (at least with traces) and identify other problems

FUTURE WORK:
* data: compute much more using pari
* Review LMFDB issues to make sure we aren't reproducing them and that they are fixed in the new version
* Review editorial review of CMFs to make sure issues have been addressed
* data: make friends with GL_2-type genus 2 curves and base changes to HMFs and BMFs
* Add more data, in particular for weight 2 and trivial character

STABILITY CHECKS:
* verify that all links to modular forms elsewhere.  Including:

PROBABLY DONE:
* throughout: work with labels e.g. '11.2.a.a'
* navigation: reroute N/k/(conrey char label)/(Hecke orbit label)/(embedding)/ -> N/k/(char orbit label)/(Hecke orbit label)/
* navigation: reroute L/../N/k/(char orbit label)/(Hecke orbit label)/ -> L/../N/k/(min conrey char label)/(Hecke orbit label)/1/
* L-function pages: make sure L-function links with orbits works
* space pages: breadcrumbs (Alex: done probably, someone else could check if they like)
* gamma1 full space pages: breadcrumbs (Alex: done probably, someone else could check if they like)
* form pages: breadcrumbs (Alex: done probably, someone else could check if they like)
