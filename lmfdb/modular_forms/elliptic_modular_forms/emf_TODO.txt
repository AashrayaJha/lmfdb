CRITICAL (BUGS):
* form pages: error 'WebNewform' object has no nf_label (e.g. 31/4/1)
* gamma1 full space pages: WebGamma1Space object has no attribute 'old_space_latex'
* navigation: need to handle /Holomorphic/Q/79/, giving search results on level 79 forms
* form pages: need friends: whole space, L-functions for all embedded forms (Conrey labels and extra embeddings), elliptic curves
* throughout: work with labels e.g. '11.2.a.a'
* navigation: reroute N/k/(conrey char label)/(Hecke orbit label)/(embedding)/ -> N/k/(char orbit label)/(Hecke orbit label)/
* navigation: reroute L/../N/k/(char orbit label)/(Hecke orbit label)/ -> L/../N/k/(min conrey char label)/(Hecke orbit label)/1/
* form pages: some fields not displaying KNOWL e.g. 17/4/1/c
* form pages: q-expansion not displaying when it should e.g. 17/4/1/c 
* browse page: jump not working
* browse page: also browse to spaces 
* browse/search page: search on twist minimal gives search on inner twist?
* search page: put all of the search boxes in the refine search
* form pages: get cc data to display
* data: add cc data
* knowls: rigor, cande, completeness in the new scheme (and indicate that CM is rigorous but inner twist is numerical)
* L-function pages: make sure L-function links with orbits works
* data: Hecke orbit label starts at b, not a

IMPORTANT:
* search page: include dim, isCM, and field as columns in the search results
* space pages: use display q-expansions in list
* space pages: field should be linked to nf database
* space pages: add text explaining the dimensions
* space pages: properties box should have something
* Dirichlet char pages: list orbit labels
* space pages: in list, newforms are misaligned and have wrong labels
* space pages: use a multicell in the table style
* space pages: breadcrumbs
* gamma1 full space pages: breadcrumbs
* form pages: breadcrumbs
* form pages: should be three options for minimal: is minimal twist, is not minimal twist, is not known
* form pages: get download coefficients to work, say total number of coefficients
* form pages: display what the inner twists actually are (as orbits of characters)
* form pages: download to Sage/Magma/pari (using cutters)
* space pages: download to Sage/Magma/pari
* stats pages

FORMATTING:
* space pages: in title, say e.g. "of weight 4 and level 11"
* space pages: when space is empty but navigated to via URL box, handle it
* space pages: put orbit size later?
* space pages: add dimension of whole space?
* space pages: for symmetry, also list E_k^old
* search page: when no q-expansion, just leave blank (no dash)
* search page: no period after "field not in LMFDB"
* form pages: minimal should be 'twist minimal'
* L-function pages: should we use equals instead of colon?
* form pages: use nu instead of alpha (to avoid conflict with Satake)
* form pages: "Character orbit" and "(character) label" should be their own knowls
* form pages: Conrey label should be a knowl, and say character orbit
* form pages: coeffs -> coefficients, and say the number of them
* form pages: replace 'Hecke' with 'coefficients' throughout, mention Hecke in knowl instead, replace 'order' with 'ring'
* form pages: in the betas, use curly brackets in the subscripts
* form pages: include CM in properties (Gaga) box
* form pages: display relative degree
* form pages: would the basis for the Hecke ring look better in a vertical table?
* L-function pages: disable Euler product information 
* L-function pages: weight should say motivic weight
* L-function pages: fix fonts arithmetic/analytic normalization
* L-function pages: Remove n/a from friends (just leave it unclickable)
* L-function apges: is gray for negative values best? (why not two separate lists?)

IT WOULD BE NICE IF:
* form pages: had code snippets
* space pages: had code snippets
* knowls: more
* form pages: if Hecke ring is a power basis, order the generators by the powers and pretty print the q-expansion
* form pages: if Hecke field is cyclotomic, use zeta instead
* identify (if possible?) a more precise description of the twisting characters
* L-function pages: sign could be recognized as a root of unity, when applicable
* data: compute exact Hecke eigenvalues in pari, compare with computed in Magma
* data: download data from old version and compare to see matches (at least with traces) and identify other problems

FUTURE WORK:
* data: compute much more using pari
* Review LMFDB issues to make sure we aren't reproducing them and that they are fixed in the new version
* Review editorial review of CMFs to make sure issues have been addressed
* data: make friends with GL_2-type genus 2 curves and base changes to HMFs and BMFs
* Add more data, in particular for weight 2 and trivial character
