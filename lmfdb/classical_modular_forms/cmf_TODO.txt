CRITICAL (BUGS):
* knowls: reliability, cande, source in the new scheme (and indicate that CM is rigorous but inner twist is numerical) (Drew)
* zeros not matching: cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/L/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/37/2/a/a/ vs http://cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/L/EllipticCurve/Q/37/a/ (Edgar)

On data updates:
* data: populate embeddings column by computing roots of defining polynomials and matching with complex data (Edgar)
* data: populate analytic rank (Edgar)
* check data quality:
  * per each newform, check that we have all the Lfunctions, only  one for rational
  * check that the roots are all different (Edgar)
  * check that there are no duplicates in Lfun table
  * check that there are no duplicates in hecke_cc table


IMPORTANT:
* Update knowl for newspaces and mf.elliptic.space (Drew)
* Update Nk2 search and display to use the actual analytic conductor (David)
* Run consistency checks: 1. compute newform dimensions in Sage 2. compare with dims in mf_newspaces 3. compare with sum of dims in mf_newforms 4. Check that L-functions are present 5. Check that L-function instances are present (David)
* Run through all pages: 1. check that they load 2. check that it contains relevant data (label, dim, etc) 3. statistics on time to load (David)
* Undo color and logo changes (David)
* Indent q-expansion and trace expansion, less space before display precision (David)
* Pull from upstream master (David)
* Use HTML for complex embeddings (Edgar)
* Multiply all analytic conductors by 2 (David)
* Fix color.col_link, figure out why Coefficient field header is big (David)
-------------------------- Pull Request Line -------------------------------------------------
* fix and verify (try furthest top right dot): http://www.lmfdb.org/L/degree2/CuspForm/ (Alex)
* hecke_ring_index as factorization (Edgar)
* Add display strings for non-rational forms; q + (beta_1 + 2beta_3 + ...)q^2 + ... (at most 5 terms in the q^2 coefficient) (Drew)
* data: compute exact Hecke eigenvalues in pari, compare with computed in Magma (JC, Drew)
* data: add weight 1 cc data (Edgar)
* form pages: weight 1 link to Artin rep (Edgar)
* Download Euler factors
* visiting http://cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/3/ changing 3 to 12 in the level box and searching again does not change the search


GOOD:
* Factor conductors > for long enough conductors 9 digits (Edgar)
* lose the O(T^12) if degree = 12 (Edgar)
* merge L-function data of G2C, EC, ECNF with CMF using trace_hash
* Reduce clutter in the url (cleanSubmit doesn't seem to be getting everything)
* Update Fricke eigenvalue to sign of the functional equation (after figuring out where this makes sense)
* Make sure our description of labels is correct
* data: add data for is_twist_minimal
* knowls: mf.elliptic.hecke_order, mf.elliptic.embedding_label
* knowls: make sure top and bottom knowls, explicit formulas are ported over
* knowl: add remark to sturm_bound knowl for why our sturm bound is off by 1 from Sage (floor vs ceiling)


FORMATTING:
* factor out powers of p

IT WOULD BE NICE IF:
* Add tests for display_float, etc
* Add density of zero traces (Edgar)
* it would be nice if, if hecke field is cyclotomic don't use \zeta_3
* show AL dimensions for old forms as well as new
* LMFDB-wide: download link to get all data being used to generate page (see Download All Stored Data on elliptic curves)
* LMFDB-wide: equal signs consistent in terms of math-mode or not
* LMFDB-wide: change sort order in search results
* form pages: add code snippets
* space pages: add code snippets
* knowls: more
* form pages: if Hecke ring is a power basis, order the generators by the powers and pretty print the q-expansion
* identify (if possible?) a more precise description of the twisting characters
* data: download data from old version and compare to see matches (at least with traces) and identify other problems
* form pages: download to Sage/Magma/pari (using cutters)
* What about putting in "nice latex" for q-exp when available, e.g. if beta_i = nu^i and nu has a nice rep (like sqrt{N} or zeta_n)?
* form pages: provide downloads of q-expansions for Magma/pari

FUTURE WORK:
* data: compute much more using pari
* Review editorial review of CMFs to make sure issues have been addressed
* data: add trace hash for ECNF L-fun
* data: make friends with base changes of HMFs and BMFs
* Add more data, in particular for weight 2 and trivial character


NOT CMF STUFF:
* bread for maass forms looks dumb http://127.0.0.1:37777/L/ModularForm/GSp4/Q/Maass/1/1/12.46875_4.720951/1.34260324/#footer
* http://127.0.0.1:37777/L/ModularForm/GSp4/Q/Maass/1/1/12.46875_4.720951/1.34260324/#footer should explain why it is the grand canyon l-function, there is a knowl for this but after some renaming of maass forms it doesn't show on the page!
* fix hmf and bmf l-functions


TO THINK ABOUT:
* Are there good reasons for why traces are often zero for many small primes (e.g. 60.2.j)
