CRITICAL (BUGS):
* knowls: rigor, cande, source in the new scheme (and indicate that CM is rigorous but inner twist is numerical) (Drew)
* data: Add isogeny_class_label to L-functions so that we can include friend links to elliptic curves (Edgar) (we first need to add trace_hash column, see under important)


On data updates:
* data: populate embeddings column by computing roots of defining polynomials and matching with complex data (Edgar)
* data: populate analytic rank (Edgar)
* data: per each newform, check that we have all the Lfunctions



IMPORTANT:
* Check definition of trace bound mf.elliptic.trace_bound (Drew)
* Picture of space (Drew)
* Use inverse matrix when dimension is large (Drew, David)
* fix and verify: http://www.lmfdb.org/L/degree2/CuspForm/ (Alex)
* knowls: add a precision knowl for complex eigenvalues (David)
* form pages: Label headers for complex eigenvalues: chi, m (David)
* data: compute exact Hecke eigenvalues in pari, compare with computed in Magma (JC, Drew)
* Have L-function columns for both definitions of L-hash and remove duplication between L-functions of elliptic curves over Q and modular forms of weight 2 and trivial character (e.g. L/EllipticCurve/Q/11/a/ and L/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/11/2/1/a/1/) (Edgar)
* data: add weight 1 cc data (Edgar)
* form pages: weight 1 link to Artin rep (Edgar)
* form pages: download to Sage/Magma/pari (stored coefficients) (David)
* form pages: get download coefficients to work, say total number of coefficients; switch to downloads box and have versions for Sage/Magma/pari.  See EC/Q for examples.  (David)

GOOD:
* search results: Download search results (David)
* space pages: download to Sage/Magma/pari (download all the data) (David)
* form pages: make pictures transparent (Drew)
* Make sure our description of labels is correct
* data: add data for is_twist_minimal
* knowls: mf.elliptic.hecke_order, mf.elliptic.embedding_label
* knowls: make sure top and bottom knowls, explicit formulas are ported over
* knowl: add remark to sturm_bound knowl for why our sturm bound is off by 1 from Sage (floor vs ceiling)
* Review LMFDB issues to make sure we aren't reproducing them and that they are fixed in the new version
* Add fricke eigenvalue (or the sign of the functional equation) to mf_newforms and display it.
* Add analytic rank to search results?
* Make sure the knowl for labels is correct.

FORMATTING:
* form pages: replace 'Hecke' with 'coefficients' throughout, mention Hecke in knowl instead, replace 'order' with 'ring' (David)
* Change q+... in search results to something better
* horizontal scroll on the euler factors box or knowl  (Edgar)
* move show more to the left of the euler factors box  (Edgar)
* Euler factors sometimes have a dot, other times they don't (Edgar)
* do not display L-plot's for high enough degree (Edgar)
* do we really want to skip the orbits that are empty by parity reasons, is a bit odd to see "c" missing here:http://cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/25/2/

IT WOULD BE NICE IF:
* LMFDB-wide: download link to get all data being used to generate page (see Download All Stored Data on elliptic curves)
* LMFDB-wide: equal signs consistent in terms of math-mode or not
* LMFDB-wide: change sort order in search results
* form pages: add code snippets
* space pages: add code snippets
* knowls: more
* form pages: if Hecke ring is a power basis, order the generators by the powers and pretty print the q-expansion
* identify (if possible?) a more precise description of the twisting characters
* data: download data from old version and compare to see matches (at least with traces) and identify other problems
* form pages: download to Sage/Magma/pari (using cutters)
* L-function pages: fix fonts arithmetic/analytic normalization (Edgar: make issue on LMFDB)
* Atkin-Lehner dimension decomposition for the space
* What about putting in "nice latex" for q-exp when available, e.g. if beta_i = nu^i and nu has a nice rep (like sqrt{N} or zeta_n)?

FUTURE WORK:
* data: compute much more using pari
* Review editorial review of CMFs to make sure issues have been addressed
* data: make friends with GL_2-type genus 2 curves and base changes to HMFs and BMFs
* Add more data, in particular for weight 2 and trivial character

STABILITY CHECKS (EDGAR):
* verify that all links to modular forms elsewhere still work.  We've changed the label convention, so the following are probably broken.  See elliptic_curves/isog_class.py (search newform_label) for a fix.
bianchi_modular_forms/web_BMF.py:            bc_urls = [url_for("cmf.render_elliptic_modular_forms", level=cond, weight=2, char_orbit_label='a', hecke_orbit=iso) for cond, iso, num in curve_bc_parts]
elliptic_curves/web_ec.py:        self.newform_link = url_for("cmf.render_elliptic_modular_forms", level=cond, weight=2, char_orbit_label='a', hecke_orbit=iso)

NOT CMF STUFF:
* bread for maass forms looks dumb http://127.0.0.1:37777/L/ModularForm/GSp4/Q/Maass/1/1/12.46875_4.720951/1.34260324/#footer
* http://127.0.0.1:37777/L/ModularForm/GSp4/Q/Maass/1/1/12.46875_4.720951/1.34260324/#footer should explain why it is the grand canyon l-function, there is a knowl for this but after some renaming of maass forms it doesn't show on the page!

TO THINK ABOUT:
* Figure out why the AL-signs are opposite the traces of the corresponding a_p
* Are there good reasons for why traces are often zero for many small primes (e.g. 60.2.j)

PROBABLY DONE:
* throughout: work with labels e.g. '11.2.a.a'
* L-function pages: make sure L-function links with orbits works
* space pages: breadcrumbs (Alex: done probably, someone else could check if they like)
* gamma1 full space pages: breadcrumbs (Alex: done probably, someone else could check if they like)
* form pages: breadcrumbs (Alex: done probably, someone else could check if they like)
* form pages: should be three options for minimal: is minimal twist, is not minimal twist, is not known
* form pages: display what the inner twists actually are (as orbits of characters). Never rigorous.  "This form admits X nontrivial inner twists".  Knowl for inner twists.  Asterisk depending on proven field (David)
* The following external links should work, but it may be worth checking:
