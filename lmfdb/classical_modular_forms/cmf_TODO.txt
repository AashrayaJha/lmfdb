CRITICAL (BUGS):

OUTSTANDING:
* Some newspaces that are in boxes with straces set don't have trace_bound, num_forms, hecke_orbit_dims set
  - 101.7.f, box = {u'nonzero_newspace_count': 270662, u'Nmax': 4000, u'newspace_count': 270662, u'embeddings': False, u'lfunctions': False, u'Nmin': 101, u'Nk_count': 13585, u'embedding_count': 2133008444L, u'Nk2max': 40000, u'Nk2min': 4001, u'kmax': 12, u'Dmin': 101, u'split': False, u'omin': 2, u'eigenvalues': False, u'nonzero_Nk_count': 13585, u'traces': False, u'straces': True}
  - 25.13.f, {u'nonzero_newspace_count': 5747, u'newspace_count': 5747, u'embeddings': False, u'lfunctions': False, u'Nmin': 25, u'Nk_count': 1475, u'embedding_count': 4564288L, u'kmin': 13, u'Nk2max': 40000, u'Nk2min': 4001, u'Dmin': 101, u'split': False, u'omin': 2, u'eigenvalues': False, u'nonzero_Nk_count': 1475, u'traces': False, u'straces': True}

IMPORTANT:
* Fix Satake angles in weight 1 (Drew)
* Fix sturm bound in mf_gamma1 (Drew)
* Figure out discrepancies in counts between mf_boxes and mf_gamma1 (Drew)
* Change title when single m specified, jump and make sure m box is present (David)
* Write and run validation procedure to verify modular form data after it has been uploaded to postgres.  Figure out how to incorporate this into our long term workflow. (David, Edgar)
 - see https://github.com/JohnCremona/CMFs/blob/master/PostgresSchema.md for detailed list of verifications for each table
 - see scripts/verify_data.py
 - check that we have all the L-functions that we expect (Edgar)
 - check self duality -> through the number field data, embedding data, lfunction self_dual
 - check inner_twists through ap data (if feasible)
 - parallelize (Edgar)
* Add notes on provability/completeness to Artin image knowl (Drew)
* Update the text at the top of the plot page http://cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/L/degree2/CuspForm/ to be a knowl, not only trivial character now so f.e. needs fixing (how?). (David/David)
* Prove self-twists for 1 newform where it is currently not proved (Drew)
* Compute L-functions:
  - 23.39.d.a and 23.41.d.a (CC ap data ready for 23.39.d.a, Edgar, still waiting on 23.41.d.a, Drew)
  - 24.37.h.c and 24.39.h.c (CC ap data ready for 24.37.b.c, Edgar, still waiting on 24.39.h.c, Drew)
  - k > 200, N <= 10, Nk^2 <= 100,000 (??) waiting for Dave Platt
* Missing data:
  - embedding data for 23:41:4 dimension 790 (Drew -- this may not finish before PR)

FINAL CHECKS:
* Make sure indexes are appropriate, especially for new sort orders (Edgar)
* Update RCS knowls to match final data set (Drew)
* Finalize announcement e-mail and PR (David)

-------------------------- Pull Request Line -------------------------------------------------
* Prove all analytic ranks (Drew)
* Add trace forms and portraits for all newspaces and gamma1 of wt k > 1 and Nk^2 <= 40000 -- currently we have everything for N <= 4000 (including wt 1) and Nk^2 <= 40000 (Drew).
* code snippets for form and space pages in Sage and Pari.
* Lift projective reps for weight one forms to artin reps whereever possible (Drew)
* add L-functions instances for Artin rep (Edgar)
* Speed up Dirichlet character search (currently doing a ton of lookup and lucky calls rather than using search() (David LD)
* Compute completions at global fields (primes dividing level), compute decomposition groups, p-adic embeddings (David)
* Add completeness table and metadata in order to make claims about provability
* Reduce clutter in the url: count, start, hidden_search_type (David)
* Prevent all=1 in cleanSubmit when no arguments from browse page.
* q-expansion bigint knowls display off screen with 100 coefficients (http://cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/2/218/a/b/)
* Add related objects from Artin representations back to weight 1 forms
* Remove Future Plans page and port everything to github

CRITICAL DB:
* on a delete, if restat fails on a delete command it still commits the delete command


COLLABORATION SUGGESTIONS:
* Forms that have no zeros except at the cusps

GOOD:
* Create links to dynamics stats from each entry in the curated stats
* figure out the sort order for lfunc_lfunctions
* merge L-function data of G2C, EC, ECNF with CMF using trace_hash
* knowls: make sure top and bottom knowls, explicit formulas are ported over
* knowl: add remark to sturm_bound knowl for why our sturm bound is off by 1 from Sage (floor vs ceiling)
* data: download data from old version and compare to see matches (at least with traces) and identify other problems

IT WOULD BE NICE IF:
* add inner twist data for all newforms (compute using embedding data)
* add inner twist group structures
* use linear hecke kernels (potentially much faster than our current hecke cutters)
* search on character degree?
* if hecke field is cyclotomic don't use \zeta_3 (why not?)
* show AL dimensions for old forms as well as new
* identify (if possible?) a more precise description of the twisting characters
* form pages: provide downloads for pari
* In the link back from an L-function to a modular form, preserve the L-function URL

FUTURE WORK:
* data: for spaces where we do not compute an algebraic q-expansion, still give the first few Hecke polynomials
* data: compute much more using pari
* Review editorial review of CMFs to make sure issues have been addressed
* data: add trace hash for ECNF L-fun
* data: make friends with base changes of HMFs and BMFs
* Add more data, in particular for weight 2 and trivial character
* data: add data for is_twist_minimal
* Improve modular form plots, consider plotting images using arb

NOT CMF STUFF:
* add documentation for set_sort
* list the analytic conductor on the L-function pages
* remove non-existent instances from lfunc_instances and perhaps stop checking if they exists in names_and_urls
* convert 1.1 projection to 1 in _parse_projection?
* cache queries on gps_transitive?
* rewrite code Dirichlet series, in particular use bigint knowls in the arithmetic version
* convert other columns to arrays, as GIN indexes for jsonb only supports containment, try: db.nf_fields.analyze({'ramps':{'$contains':[2,3]}}) vs db.nf_fields.analyze({'ramps':[2,3]}) vs db.nf_fields.analyze({'ramps':{'$in':[2,3]}})
* copy_from and update_many see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8910494/how-to-update-selected-rows-with-values-from-a-csv-file-in-postgres
* have the call method on a table to do just a search
* reset start with javascript
* generalize search_types
* hidden != search clean hidden
* add utf8 check to pyflakes
* pick columns and sort order on search results
* add UIs to pick random objects with contraints
* bread for maass forms looks dumb http://127.0.0.1:37777/L/ModularForm/GSp4/Q/Maass/1/1/12.46875_4.720951/1.34260324/#footer
* http://127.0.0.1:37777/L/ModularForm/GSp4/Q/Maass/1/1/12.46875_4.720951/1.34260324/#footer should explain why it is the grand canyon l-function, there is a knowl for this but after some renaming of maass forms it doesn't show on the page!
* fix hmf and bmf l-functions
* Shrink the sidebar with a button analogous to the properties shrinker
* Related fields for dirichlet characters that are Kronecker symbols
* Change color of input/select elements if they're actively constraining a search (easy to forget that you've constrained something)
* col_type is cached, add to FAQ
* Work on spacing between coefficients and variables in web_latex_poly: lmfdb/utils.py
* avoid access exclusive lock with the alter table when using copy from
* checklist is broken
* Add validate_header function for copy_from, reload, etc (David)
* Add replace_from, copy_to+copy_from (with sort order) function to db_backend (David)
* In debug_info.html, queries with dollar signs aren't escaped, and katex tries to parse them.
* No longer support changing count from refine search elsewhere in LMFDB (it screws up Prev and Next)
* Move data from US Central to US East Coast
* It would be good to have an explanation of the connections in the "related objects" links when possible
* Complex and rational extension types for postgres
* In create_table, make label unique and add index; port to existing tables (David)
* enable autovacuum on postgres config
* Rename mf.elliptic.hecke-operator mf.elliptic.trace-expansion, and other knowls with hyphens.  Create script to search and replace hyphens.
* LMFDB-wide: download link to get all data being used to generate page (see Download All Stored Data on elliptic curves)
* LMFDB-wide: equal signs consistent in terms of math-mode or not
* LMFDB-wide: change sort order in search results
* Saved queries for demos (cf checklist)

Style:
* For the moment we use scientific notation for the Dirichlet coefficients if the integers or fractions take too much space. This is not a CMF issue
* For the imaginary parts that end in ".", I added a space between them and the "i". See http://cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/L/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/7/5/d/a/5/1/ . This is not a CMF issue

TO THINK ABOUT:
* Are there good reasons for why traces are often zero for many small primes (e.g. 60.2.j)
