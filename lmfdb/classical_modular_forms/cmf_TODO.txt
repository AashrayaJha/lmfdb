CRITICAL (BUGS):
* knowls: reliability, cande, source in the new paradigm (Drew)
* Update downloads for coefficients, trace form, magma to handle spare cyclotomic rep (David, JV)
* Update Gamma1 pages where we do not have all the forms like http://cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/500/3/ and http://cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/1500/2/ to display n/a in newforms column if the num_forms column in the mf_newspace row is not set and use dimension from mf_newspace table, don't sum neform dimensions
* Update Gamma1 dimension table to display dimension and links for spaces that have an entry in mf_newspaces
* Update WebNewforsmSpace to handle newspaces where trace_bound and num_forms are not set, and update newspace pages to handle this case (the page should display dimension and oldspace decomposition info, but not Hecke orbit decomposition).
* The newspace search should filter for spaces where num_newforms is set, it is currently broken (e.g. http://cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/?count=50&hidden_search_type=Spaces&level=3000&weight=2&dim=1-&prime_quantifier=exact&search_type=Spaces)

IMPORTANT:
* When displaying character orbits in newspace tables like http://cmfs.lmfdb.xyz/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/1500/2/ use ... to abbreviate long lists of Conrey labels, e.g. for the space 1500.2.bi the character orbit should be shown as \chi_1500([17,\ldots,1433]).
* On stats page when listing the number of newspaces only count newspaces where num_forms is set (so the count should be 306,457 not 1,515,717).
* Use analytic_rank_proved once we have conjectural analytic ranks in weight 1 (Edgar, David)
* Add download link to create forms in magma (JV and Drew)
* Prove image types for all weight one forms (Drew)
* Compute L-functions for weight-1 and forms of trivial character past Nk^2 > 4000 (Edgar)
* Compare trivial char data with Stein database (Drew)
* Compare dihedral weight one data with Magma (Drew)
* Make light gray lighter gray (David)
* Write and run validation procedure to verify modular form data after it has been uploaded to postgres (Drew)
* Diagonalize basis matrix when it is the product of a diagonal matrix and a permutation matrix (Drew)

* Don't duplicate in statistics setup (David)
* Add inputs in dynamic stats for options (e.g. totaller, etc) (David)

FINAL CHECKS:
* Make sure indexes are appropriate (Edgar)

-------------------------- Pull Request Line -------------------------------------------------
* Work on spacing between coefficients and variables in web_latex_poly: lmfdb/utils.py
* Display disriminant of coefficient ring on newform pages
* Fix drop_column method so that it deletes statistics including that column (David)
* Lift projective reps for weight one forms to artin reps whereever possible (Drew)
* code snippets for form and space pages (Drew)
* add ECQD and genus 2 curves to friends (Edgar)
* Speed up Dirichlet character search (currently doing a ton of lookup and lucky calls rather than using search() (David LD)
* avoid access exclusive lock with the alter table when using copy from
* Compute completions at global fields (primes dividing level), compute decomposition groups, embeddings (David)


KNOWL FEATURES: (March)
* Revision history and reversion (all versions stored in kwl_knowls table)
* Multiple versions for beta and prod (needs a review status column)
* Status column (smallint): reviewed, beta, deleted
* Renaming: change the id on every knowl (no history)
* jsonb row with links to other knowls
* search with wildcards
* View all knowls: SELECT DISTINCT ON id FROM kwl_knowls WHERE status != 'deleted' ORDER BY timestamp DESC
* Edit locks (prevent editing if locked, get own locks): new table with (id, timestamp, username)
* Label as annotation (column: boolean? or type?) automatically mark as such if navigated from a top knowl link (use .top and .bottom convention)
* Link back to object from annotations (another field which is a link back to object)
* Viewable diffs (on the fly)
* Do we care about porting data from kwl_history table? No.
* Add column to user table giving power to review knowls
* Comments: anyone can leave a comment.  Anyone can search for knowls with comments.
* Add reviewer column to knowl table; update edit interface.  Do we want reviewing to create a new copy of the knowl, or edit most recent copy?  If second, should have a review timestamp.
* Use KNOWL_INC more....
* Preserve author history

COLLABORATION SUGGESTIONS:
* Forms that have no zeros except at the cusps
* Protocol buffers

GOOD:
* col_type is cached add to FAQ
* self-twist sometimes wraps
* move the constant coefficient in q-exp coefficients to the left
* merge L-function data of G2C, EC, ECNF with CMF using trace_hash
* Reduce clutter in the url (cleanSubmit doesn't seem to be getting everything)
* Update Fricke eigenvalue to sign of the functional equation (after figuring out where this makes sense)
* knowls: mf.elliptic.hecke_order, mf.elliptic.embedding_label
* knowls: make sure top and bottom knowls, explicit formulas are ported over
* knowl: add remark to sturm_bound knowl for why our sturm bound is off by 1 from Sage (floor vs ceiling)

FORMATTING:
* Consider switching level and weight on browse and refine search input boxes

IT WOULD BE NICE IF:
* it would be nice if, if hecke field is cyclotomic don't use \zeta_3
* show AL dimensions for old forms as well as new
* LMFDB-wide: download link to get all data being used to generate page (see Download All Stored Data on elliptic curves)
* LMFDB-wide: equal signs consistent in terms of math-mode or not
* LMFDB-wide: change sort order in search results
* knowls: more
* form pages: if Hecke ring is a power basis, order the generators by the powers and pretty print the q-expansion
* identify (if possible?) a more precise description of the twisting characters
* data: download data from old version and compare to see matches (at least with traces) and identify other problems
* form pages: download to Sage/Magma/pari (using cutters)
* What about putting in "nice latex" for q-exp when available, e.g. if beta_i = nu^i and nu has a nice rep (like sqrt{N} or zeta_n)?
* form pages: provide downloads of q-expansions for Magma/pari

FUTURE WORK:
* data: for spaces where we do not compute an algebraic q-expansion, still give the first few Hecke polynomials
* data: compute much more using pari
* Review editorial review of CMFs to make sure issues have been addressed
* data: add trace hash for ECNF L-fun
* data: make friends with base changes of HMFs and BMFs
* Add more data, in particular for weight 2 and trivial character
* data: add data for is_twist_minimal

NOT CMF STUFF:
* reset start with javascript
* generalize search_types
* hidden != search clean hidden
* add utf8 check to pyflakes
* pick columns and sort order on search results
* add UIs to pick random objects with contraints
* bread for maass forms looks dumb http://127.0.0.1:37777/L/ModularForm/GSp4/Q/Maass/1/1/12.46875_4.720951/1.34260324/#footer
* http://127.0.0.1:37777/L/ModularForm/GSp4/Q/Maass/1/1/12.46875_4.720951/1.34260324/#footer should explain why it is the grand canyon l-function, there is a knowl for this but after some renaming of maass forms it doesn't show on the page!
* fix hmf and bmf l-functions
* Shrink the sidebar with a button analogous to the properties shrinker
* Related fields for dirichlet characters that are Kronecker symbols

TO THINK ABOUT:
* Are there good reasons for why traces are often zero for many small primes (e.g. 60.2.j)
