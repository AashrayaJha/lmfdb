KNOWL FEATURES: (March)
* Revision history and reversion (all versions stored in kwl_knowls table)
* Multiple versions for beta and prod (needs a review status column)
* Status column (smallint): reviewed, beta, deleted
* Renaming: change the id on every knowl (no history)
* jsonb row with links to other knowls
* search with wildcards
* View all knowls: SELECT DISTINCT ON id FROM kwl_knowls WHERE status != 'deleted' ORDER BY timestamp DESC
* Edit locks (prevent editing if locked, get own locks): new table with (id, timestamp, username)
* Label as annotation (column: boolean? or type?) automatically mark as such if navigated from a top knowl link (use .top and .bottom convention)
* Link back to object from annotations (another field which is a link back to object)
* Viewable diffs (on the fly)
* Do we care about porting data from kwl_history table? No.
* Add column to user table giving power to review knowls
* Comments: anyone can leave a comment.  Anyone can search for knowls with comments.
* Add reviewer column to knowl table; update edit interface.  Do we want reviewing to create a new copy of the knowl, or edit most recent copy?  If second, should have a review timestamp.
* Use KNOWL_INC more....
* Preserve author history
