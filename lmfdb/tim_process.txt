# For importing artin into mongodb
python import_generic.py artin_file.json limbo.artinXXX

# For importing nfgal into mongodb
python import_generic.py nfgal_file.json limbo.nfgalXXX

Then, need to change the first line of databases/Dokchitser_databases.py to match the information above limbo.artinXXX and limbo.nfgalXXX

# For linking to the number field database:
# This adds a "label" field to every entry in the number field galois groups database, given by the lkabel used in John Jones' nf database
# It does that by computing the polredabs of the polynomial supplied by Tim
# Most of the time, this polynomial is already the polredabs, so some time is wasted there. But that's not always the case.
python number_fields/link_tim_other.py 

# Adding conductor length into conductor_plus field of artin rep, for searching
python artin_representations/inject_conductor_len.py 

# From a sage -sh, run the following to create indices:
>>> import lmfdb
>>> lmfdb.artin_representations.main.initialize_indices()
>>> lmfdb.number_field_galois_groups.main.initialize_indices()
