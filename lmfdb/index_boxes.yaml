title: search
image: search
content: find mathematical object having given properties,
  e.g. number fields, elliptic curves...

title: a database
image: families
content: the LMFDB is a huge database of a lot of objects
  obtained from heavy computations. Anyone can upload and make
  available his own data.
links:
  - [ elliptic curves, '/EllipticCurve/Q/?conductor=1-99' ]
  - [ Maass forms, /L/degree3/MaassForm/ ]
  - [ tables of zeroes, /zeros/first/ ]
  - [ Hilbert modular forms, '/ModularForm/GL2/TotallyReal/?field_label=Qsqrt5' ]

title: nice plots and much more
image: plot
content: L functions pages show the relation between algebraic and analytic properties.
  In particular, the Z-function plot allows to check visually the Riemann
  hypothesis.
links:
  - [ riemann zeta, /L/Riemann/]
  - [ elliptic curve, /L/EllipticCurve/Q/234446.a/]

title: learn mathematics
content: knowls are a smart way to learn or remember definitions without
  loosing context
image: knowledge
links:
  - [ introductory page, /introduction ]
  - [ knowledge page, /knowledge ]

title: explore links
image: map
content: the lmfdb explores both known and conjectural links
  between mathematical objects
links:
  - [ the great L functions map, /bigpicture ]
---
title: navigate
image: related
content: the LMFDB philosophy is that any mathematical object should have
  its homepage, and show links to its natural friends, so that navigation
  is easy.
links:
  - [ the lmfdb web of objects, notyetavailable ]
  - [ elliptic curve, L/EllipticCurve/Q/5077.a/ ]

title: get code and investigate beyond
image: compute
content: most objects suggest the appropriate commands for making
  computions within Sage, Magma or Pari.
links:
  - [ elliptic curves, /EllipticCurve/Q/234446.a1 ]

title: a reference
image: cite
content: experts can use the lmfdb as a reference and cite
  its urls in papers
links:
  - [ citation policy, /citation ]
---
title: free data, free software
content: The LMFDB is a free collaboration.
  It relies heavily on the computer algebra systems Sage, Magma and Pari
