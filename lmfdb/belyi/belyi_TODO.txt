TODO:
- genus 0 corner cases
- hyperelliptic RR
- hyperelliptic Newton
- compute lots of maps
- deg 7, g=2,3
- timings/update tables
- local sanity check before global in belyi_main
- use sage to compute monodromy for computing entire Galois orbits
- on lmfdb when the number field is not in the database, don't panic!
- show automorphism group on lmfdb page for galmaps
- display coeffs for map, phi = (a0xy+a1xy^2+...)/(b0+b1x+...) where a0=... etc
- database of passports even if the maps are not computed

It would be nice if:
- sort a,b,c
- when F=QQ, use polyring over QQ not QQ(nu)
- Friends
- embeddings in binary
- factorization of phi (or divisor)
- tripleredabs?
- display info about group
- download curve/map in magma then in sage and/or pari
