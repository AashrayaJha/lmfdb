Groups play an important role in mathematics.  The LMFDB has data on
two types of groups: Galois groups and lattices.
</div>
<br>
<div>
Galois groups appear in various places.  Naturally, they appear
for global and local number fields, but also as Galois groups of
local factors of L-functons.  Strictly speaking, these are transitive
subgroups of $S_n$ up to conjugation, but due to their application here,
we refer to them as simply Galois groups.
</div>
<br>
<div>
Lattices appear in multiple places in number theory, from the ring of
integers of a number field, to the Mordell-Weil group (modulo torsion)
of an elliptic curve over $\Q$, or more generally, of an abelian variety
over a number field.
